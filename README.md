# PolLar
This is a web application for creating polls. Its functionality is described below. The app is publicly available and one can have access to it using this link : https://pollar-app.onrender.com.

## Purpose and Main Idea 
The main purpose of creating this platform is the integration of the main stages of collective decision making : 
  1. Submission of suggestions by the members of the poll
  2. Voting of these suggestions (specifically, each participant votes for 3 suggestions, ranking them in order of preference)
  3. Results 
PoLlar polls go through these 3 phases.

## Roles
There are 2 roles in each PolLar poll :
  1. Admin : The creator of the poll, he defines the main parameters of the poll (such as the number of participants).
  >[!IMPORTANT]
  > The admin of the poll does not define which options (or suggestions) will be voted on. The purpose of PolLar is to collect suggestions from all the participants of the poll!
  2. Participant : participants can make suggestions, vote and finally see the results of the poll. If the corresponding option is enabled, participants can see the suggestions of other participants during the suggestions' phase

## A complete use case
The main page of PolLar is the one below.

There are 3 sections, one for joining a poll, one for creating a poll and one for checking the status of a poll (for admins). Firstly, one can create a poll defining the parameters of it. An example is shown below.
